#running MetaPhlan/Strainphlan

When generating the marker files for Strainphlan, metaphlan detects Bm and Bp when the samples only contain Bp.
The workaround for this is to recode all Bm samples as actually Bp. This can be done by using the pickle package in python and readingi n the .pkl file. 

Code is found in ~/candidature/aim2/metaphlan/modify_pkl.py

Once this is done, the new .pkl file needs to be stored in it's own folder in metaphlan. 

#TODO:

1. test if new modified db/.pkl works DONE
2. test if any Bm exists in the db DONE

3. rerun metaphlan DONE
4. need to build index of mpa_v21 using bowtie2 for strainphlan to run. 
	~ cmd: bowtie2-build -f <reference_in> <bt2_base>
	~ before I can do the above, I need to dump the new mpa_v21 database as fasta
